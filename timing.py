# define a function for timing overall plot of one image at a different scales for each algorithm. should take image file as parameter

# define a function for timing plot seam acrving (minimumseam) algo only of one image at a different scales for each algorithm. should take image file as parameter

# define a function for timing plof of images of different sizes at a fixed scale s for each algorithm. should take scale as input parameter
# this also need to have images available for different sizes
# do for n*n images from internet may be some webiste which gives same image of multiple pixel sizes
